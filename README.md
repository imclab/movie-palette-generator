movie-palette-generator
=======================

Takes the frames of a video file and compresses them into a single image in order to see the overall color palette.


###Setting up
If you wish to just use the program, you can run it with the precompiled files in /bin.  Edit the **config.properties** with the correct file name(escape the backslashes) and change the frame size and every n frames if you wish.  I got decent results with the provided values.  

**WARNING ABOUT EVERY N FRAMES** Using less than 10 will take a lot longer, more than 10 may look bad.

###File types tested and working:

* AVI
* WMV
* MKV


###Results
